# gaussian_elminiation
This project was created by Istvan Zsigmond as a project for a course called 'Numerical methods in Physics II.' at Eötvös Loránd University. The code executes a Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting upon an input matrix and returns the invert matrix. The code was written in C.
